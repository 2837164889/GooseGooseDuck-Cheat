Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack!Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack!

Free open-source cheat software for **Goose Goose Duck**

** ONLY FOR WINDOWS!!!!!**

(Tested on windows 10, not tested in other Windows versions. But I think Windows 11 would work well.)

(I think it may be inefficient because I am not good at programming. If you think there's something to improve, please give me your active opinion.)


#### It doesn't matter if it's not fun, and it's made for those who want to win.
#### It is also made for personal study, and I am not responsible for any problems caused by using/abusing the project.

## So, how to use?

Just complie it with Visual Studio, and inject with your favorite injector.
(Before compile, please check "Release x64".)

After the dll injected, press insert to turn on or turn off the cheat menu.
(Before inject make sure that the resolution of the game window is 1280x720)

## Features

- User & role list (working on)
- Draw everyone's location on map (Scheduled)
- GUI
- AOBScan for some offsets (Scheduled)


## Known bug

- When inject, the game crashed. Please wait for a moment and re-inject the dll.
- After end the game or vote time, sometimes the game crashed. I don't know about this. If you know about this, please notice me.

#Postscript

If you have any trouble with minhook during compiling, please rebuild Minhook and replace "libMinHook.x64.lib" with your own. (Don't change the file name!)
If you think the ESP feature is not working, click anywhere on the screen to move the character.
